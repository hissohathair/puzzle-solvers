    "# Sudoku\n",
    "\n",
    "[Sudoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku) is a kind of puzzle game played on a square grid of 9 x 9 cells. Every cell must have a number from 1 to 9, but there are constraints on where the numbers can go:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A number cannot be repeated in the same row\n",
    "2. or repeated in the same column\n",
    "3. or repeated in the same \"box\", which is a region of 3 x 3 cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can play Sudoku online at [Sudoku.com](https://sudoku.com/), or [Web Sudoku](https://www.websudoku.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "When Sudoku first became popular I tried to write a program to solve any puzzle. It was...not entirely successful. When I decided I wanted to learn how to use Jypter Notebooks better I thought a puzle solver might be fun to try again. So this exercise is as much about learning Jupyter, Pandas, Matplotlib and Python, as it is about Sudoku.\n",

    "\n",
    "* A *region* is a *row*, *column*, or *box*.\n",
    "* *Row* and *column* are fairly obvious. I use the term *box* to describe the 3x3 grids.\n",

    "A Sudoku puzzle is a kind of \"[latin square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_square)\", which is an N x N array of N values, where no value is repeated in a row or column. Sudoku adds a variation for boxes which impose an additional constraint. There are N boxes (usually =9), and they are also a 2D array of N values. Boxes do not overlap so their dimenisons are $\\sqrt{N}x\\sqrt{N}$. On puzzle grids the boxes are usually outlined with a heavier line.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few other puzzle types which build their own additional rules on top of latin squares, so I've constructed a class [LatinSquare](puzzle/latinsquare.py) which has the basic rules in common to all latin squares, and then a class [SudokuPuzzle](puzzle/sudoku.py) which adds the additional Sudoku rules.\n"

By chance I had been reading about [making Conda's package installation performance faster](https://www.anaconda.com/blog/understanding-and-improving-condas-performance) and read that part of the process for reconciling package dependencies included expressing the package constraints as an SAT problem. I took it as a sign.\n",

The implementation in [SATSolver](puzzle/sudoku.py) however is Schnell's work, and uses [pycosat](https://pypi.org/project/pycosat/), a Python wrapper for [PicoSAT](http://fmv.jku.at/picosat/), for the actual SAT solving part. This library is very fast, thanks to a combination of optimised C code and about 20 years of academic research. In tests, it never took longer than 50 ms to solve any puzzle.\n"
